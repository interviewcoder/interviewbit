| Problem in interviewBit |          Note       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------| 
| L4 check points: [Find Next Greater Element](http://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/stacks-and-queues/problems/nextgreater/) | use stack to keep indices of an ascending order |
| [Hashing] Two Sum | In leetcode, there is only one solution, InterviewBit requires to find the combination with least number for index1 |
| [Binary Search] [Books](http://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/binary-search/problems/books/) ] | difficult binary search |
| [Binary Search] [Power remainer](http://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/binary-search/problems/pow/) | difficult: very larger power |
| [Two Pointers] [Trick.MAXONE](http://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/two-pointers/problems/maxone/) | See also [Leetcode 076] keep a window and update window when invariant is broken |
| [Two Pointers][Trick.APP3PTR](http://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/two-pointers/problems/array3ptr/) | use two pointers on sorted array, move the pointer to shrink gap |
| [Two Pointers] [Sorting.DIFF](http://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/two-pointers/problems/diffk/) | fast-slow window, not all sorted array is going to use binary search |
| [Arrays] [BucketOrSorting.HOTEL](http://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/arrays/problems/hotel/) | Great problem, build an event queue to solve problem |
